## `685b5f75b283ab64b56ae5b6ac046b99692d3fbd`, 2018-07-18

Command as above + observer:

```
mix run --no-start -e ':observer.start(); OMG.Performance.setup_and_run(8_000, 32, %{block_every_ms: 15_000})'
```

Observer tells us that peak memory usage (total) is ~600MB, oscillating around ~400MB most of the time.

Some drop in throughput since last dump, but still bottlenecks lie elsewhere.
